## About The Project

:hammer: A functional but in development project :wrench:

This is a simple concept for a mini social media towards to post publication. It's a meme project made purely for fun and for the purpose of learning several web programming tools.

A website is available for experimenting at:
https://philosophypster.netlify.app/

*Note: Due to the free plan using Heroku and other optimization problems, you may find the post loading to be very slow at first. This is on the top of my priority to fix.*


### Built With
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org)
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
* [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
